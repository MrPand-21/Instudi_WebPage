## Considerations

- `utils/` used in `components/` to make it more readable and usable. Since there is only one page, in `pages/` there is only one page.
- There are only 2 files in `styles/` which are `styles/global.css` and `utils.module.css` and all other css files were written under their corresponding folder.
- Be aware to make your configurations in "next.config.js".
